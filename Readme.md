This code defines a class called MLP, which stands for Multi-Layer Perceptron. It is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for classification and regression tasks.

The MLP class has several methods that define its behavior. The __init__ method initializes the weights and biases of the network, as well as its architecture (input size, hidden size, and output size). The ReLU, derivative_ReLU, Softmax, and cross_entropy methods define the activation functions and loss function used by the network.

The forward_propagation method takes an input x and a label y and computes the prediction of the network as well as the error between the prediction and the true label. The back_propagation method takes the input, label, and cache (intermediate values computed during forward propagation) and computes the gradients of the weights and biases with respect to the loss.

The update_parameters method takes the gradients and a learning rate alpha and updates the weights and biases of the network using gradient descent. The compute_loss method takes a set of inputs X and labels Y and computes the average loss over all examples.

The fit method takes a set of inputs X, labels Y, number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and a schedule flag, and trains the network using mini-batch gradient descent. The method also includes a learning rate decay schedule that can be turned on or off using the schedule flag.

The predict method takes a set of inputs X and returns the predictions of the network for each input. The evaluate_acc method takes a set of inputs X and labels Y and returns the accuracy of the network on these examples.
